Things are evolving dramatically in embedded design space. Until relatively recently, computation-intensive tasks like security, analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) were predominantly to be found in the Cloud. Now, such tasks are increasingly being deployed in devices at the Edge; that is, the boundary where the internet meets, and interfaces with, the real world.

Another trend is the rapidly increasing use of RISC-V processors, where RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles that is made available under open-source licenses. As reported by Jeff Shepard in his RISC-V is Growing and Offers Stability, Scalability, and Security article on MicrocontrollerTips.com, “Semico Research has projected that 62.4 billion RISC-V CPU cores will be sold by 2025. While that’s only about six percent of the overall CPU core market, RISC-V is an emerging technology that most designers should follow and become increasingly familiar with.”

Also of interest is the increasing use of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in embedded systems. Certain data processing tasks, including many AI/ML algorithms, can benefit from parallel processing. Traditional microprocessors (MPUs) and microcontrollers (MCUs) are great when it comes to decision-making tasks, but they can be inefficient in terms of time and power consumption when it comes to implementing raw data processing algorithms. By comparison, the programmable fabric in FPGAs (a) can be configured to implement hardware accelerator (HA) functions that perform data processing algorithms in a massively parallel fashion (b), thereby providing fast performance with low latency while consuming relatively little power.

In many cases, it is required to augment these hardware accelerators with a central processing unit (CPU) that can perform high-level decision-making and control functions. As opposed to a hard-core CPU that is implemented directly in the silicon, some of the FPGA’s programmable fabric can be used to implement a soft-core CPU along with an associated bus structure (address, data, control) and any required peripheral intellectual property (IP) functions (c).

Another interesting advantage of FPGA/SoC is startup time - something that benefit most of Apple laptops, and perfectly visualized on Lattice MachXO3D chip - designed for automotive world:

Lattice’s flash-based MachXO3™ FPGAs provide “instant-on” capabilities that allow them to be the platform’s first-on, last-off devices. As a result, these devices dominate the market for system control and power management functionality.
