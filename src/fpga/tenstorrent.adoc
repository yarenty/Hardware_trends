Tenstorrent: full-stack software + general architecture, software includes compiler and runtime dynamic optimization

Tenstorrent has anticipated this growth and has designed an architecture inherently built to handle these massive workloads effectively and efficiently.

* Fully programmable architecture that supports fine-grain
conditional execution, dynamic sparsity handling, and an
unprecedented ability to scale via tight integration of
computation and networking
* Difficult communication and synchronization bottlenecks
addressed
* Compiler based flexible parallelization
* Fine grain adaptation of compute graph at runtime
* Consistently high performance / utilization, regardless of
model type, batching
* Facilitating machines to go beyond pattern recognition and into cause-and-effect learning

Generally this is startup - quite early stage, and until Jan/2021 I was not sure if it will stay for another year, however there is some light at the end of the tunnel:

TORONTO – January 6, 2021 - Jim Keller joins Tenstorrent as President and CTO.

Tenstorrent, a hardware start-up developing next generation computers, announces the addition of industry veteran Jim Keller as President, CTO, and board member.
During his long and impactful career he has helped create some of today’s most iconic technology including the AMD Zen, K7 (Athlon) and K8 micro-architectures, Apple A4-A7 processors, the x86-64 instruction set and HyperTransport interconnect.
