*GateMateTM FPGA*

Suitable from university projects up to high volume applications.

The GateMateTM FPGA family of Cologne Chip AG addresses all application requirements of small to medium size FPGAs. Very low power and speed applications are feasible. Logic capacity, power consumption, package size and PCB compatibility are best in class. GateMateTM FPGAs combine these features with lowest cost in industry making the devices well suited from University projects to high volume applications. Because of the outstanding Circuit size/Cost ratio, even new applications now can use the benefits of FPGAs.

All this is based on a novel FPGA architecture combining a special Central Programmable Element (CPE) with a smart routing engine. Furthermore, arbitrary size Multipliers are usable. Memory aware applications can use block RAMs with bit widths of 1 to 80 bits. Even bit-wise enable is possible.

General Purpose IOs (GPIOs) can use different voltage levels from 1.2 to 2.5 Volt. GPIOs can be configured as single-ended or LVDS differential type. Furthermore a high speed SerDes interface is available.

GateMateTM FPGAs are supported by EasyConvertTM, that enables the transfer of existing FPGA designs without new synthesis. Worldclass P&R-software maps and implements the design into GateMateTM FPGA.

A Static Timing Analysis (STA) is also performed and gives evidence about critical pathes and the overall performance of a design. The design can be easily simulated using Verilog netlist and SDF timing extraction.

The devices are manufactured using GlobalfoundriesTM 28 nm SLP (Super Low Power) process. Due to manufacturing in Europe, there is no danger of trade restrictions or high taxation.

====
Colognechip company are proud of title: "Made in Germany", and looks like stable German company.

GateMate - is quite innovative and on the level with Xilinx.
Currently, they work on evaluation board and  software part - creating primitive libraries.

Recently they have delay in delivery of chips due to Corona.

They start thinking about OTP version of the chip (one time programmable) as many customers only want to program the chip once.

In long run they could be interesting player on the market.
