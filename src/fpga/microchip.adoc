Microchip offer a broad portfolio of low and mid-range density FPGAs that lead the industry in their low power consumption, reliability, and security capabilities. Our devices are unique in their use of non-volatile, instant-on technology that enables our FPGAs to deliver 30 to 50 percent lower power than competing FPGAs, immunity to radiation, and unique security features. Use our FPGAs, SoC FPGAs, and Radiation Tolerant FPGAs to meet high-bandwidth connectivity and high-data throughput needs in applications such as Hybrid and Electric Vehicles, Communications IoT Infrastructure, Industrial Controls and Automation, Spacecraft, Commercial Aircraft, and Defense Equipment.
