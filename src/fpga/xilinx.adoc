*Xilinx Solutions*

Xilinx develops highly flexible and adaptive processing platforms that enable rapid innovation across a variety of technologies—from the endpoint to the edge to the cloud. Xilinx is the inventor of the FPGA, hardware programmable SoCs, and the ACAP, designed to deliver the most dynamic processor technology in the industry.

The adaptive compute acceleration platform (ACAP) Versal architecture was designed to enable all types of developers to accelerate their whole application with disruptive performance through optimized hardware and software, providing a solution that adaptable faster than the pace of silicon design cycles.

The Xilinx UltraScale™ architecture delivers unprecedented levels of integration and capability while delivering ASIC-class system level performance for the most demanding applications requiring massive I/O & memory bandwidth, massive data flow, DSP, and packet processing performance. Our break-out portfolio also includes the industry's only hardware programmable homogeneous and heterogeneous 3D ICs with the highest bandwidth and system integration. In addition, our hardware, software, and I/O programmable SoC platform offers the flexibility and scalability of an FPGA combined with ASIC-like performance and power and the ease of use of an ASSP.

====
Xilinx is the inventor of the FPGA, programmable SoCs, and now, the ACAP. Xilinx is de facto leader in FPGA technology both hardware wise and software - where you can create lots of advanced algorithms using C/C++.
Xilinx is _"a must watch"_ in the FPGA connected world, last 2 big innovations are: 

- Adaptive compute acceleration platform (ACAP) is a fully software-programmable, heterogeneous compute platform that combines Scalar Engines, Adaptable Engines, and intelligent AI and DSP Engines
- AppStore - that is from monetization perspective - The Xilinx App Store makes it easy to evaluate, purchase, and deploy accelerated applications.

Xilinx is organizing and taking part in multiple events during each year - and most of them are worth attending. At time of polishing this report 24-25 March 2021 there is Xilinx Adapt: Data Center conference: "composable data centers", SmartNIC, real world HPC workloads, AI/Video application acceleration, DB performance, algorithmic trading, and all about acceleration for software & AI developers.


Do not forget that Xilinx ... soon will be AMD:
