* Summary 



** CPU

*** Intel - it is considered as CPU leader but question is for how long. CES 2021 (Jan. 11, 2021): Intel Announces Four New Processor Families: 11th Gen Intel® Core™ vPro® platform and Intel® Evo™ vPro® platform, new N-series 10-nanometer Intel® Pentium® Silver and Intel® Celeron® processors, 11th Gen Intel® Core™ H-series mobile processors for gaming platforms, 11th Gen Intel® Core™ S-series desktop processors (code-named “Rocket Lake-S”) and its next-generation processors (code-named “Alder Lake”).
Last year Apple resigned from using Intel CPUs, complaining about innovation - and Apple created it's own processor based on ARM architecture with GPU and NPU on-board. IBM below - in new CPUs added on-chip AI part.
However do not forget about Intel's TPUs (Habana), biggest family of FPGAs, GPU - Xe architecture, or oneAPI programming model.

*** IBM CPU - POWER 10 - not only smaller (7nm) but also with AI part - embedded matrix math accelerator (FP32, BFloat16, INT8).And go not forget technology that came with previous version - POWER 9: on-chip GZIP, CPU-GPU ultra-high bandwidth, OpenCAPI - bandwidth for communication with NICs, storage and FPGA accelerators.






** GPU

*** Intel introduces a general-purpose GPU optimized for HPC/AI acceleration based on the Xe architecture, code-named “Ponte Vecchio.”  Intel unveils additional architectural details of the Aurora Supercomputer, delivering convergence at exascale at Argonne National Laboratory. This initiative is something to check - it is nothing to do with GPGPU but cerberas wafer also ;-)





** NPU

*** Habana is Intel answer for AI world - dedicated TPU processors group into servers as: Gaudi - training, Goya - inference. On December 1, AWS announced Gaudi-based EC2 Instances with customer availability targeted to first half of 2021.


*** Marvell is rapidly expanding, and from the list of processors, applications they highly focused on telco/RAN/5G, optimizing OPEX and CAPAEX.
The Marvell O-RAN platform solution consists of silicon, software and hardware reference designs spanning the radio unit (RU), distributed unit (DU) and centralized unit (CU) with Ethernet connectivity between these network elements.
This is company that need to be closely look for.






** FPGA

*** Intel® FPGAs offer a wide variety of configurable embedded SRAM, high-speed transceivers, high-speed I/Os, logic blocks, and routing. Built-in intellectual property (IP) combined with outstanding software tools lower FPGA development time, power, and cost: Agilex, Stratix, Arria, Cyclone or full family of eASICs with ready IP cores from Intel and third-party alliance partners.
Intel FPGAs are impressive - that's why if you look for volume FPGA world is divided by Intel ans Xilinx - they both get 90% FPGA solutions, and they both are most advanced.


*** ColognaGate - proud of "made in Germany", quite good FPGA chip - GateMate - with interesting trend asked by customers -OTP - one time programmable - many customers only want to program the chip once.





** Quantum
*** IBM Quantum computing roadmap look amazing: 2021 - 127-qubit Eagle processor, 2022 - 433-qubit Osprey, 2023 - 1121-qubit Condor




** Software
*** oneAPI focuses currently on GPUs, compatibility tool which automatically migrates CUDA to DPC (data parallel C++). Feb9, 2021 - oneAPI Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) features are included in the SYCL 2020 final specification, released today by The Khronos Group, an open consortium of industry-leading companies creating advanced interoperability standards. link:https://newsroom.intel.com/articles/oneapi-dpc-features-2020-final-spec/[]

Plans (stuff to watch closely):

* Fungible - Mar 30 - product lunch
* Google - TPU v4 - waiting for more info
* tenstorrent - what will be next moves of new CTO?
* Intel On December 1, AWS announced Gaudi-based EC2 Instances with customer availability targeted to first half of 2021
* Intel oneAPI - worth watching news page - link:https://techdecoded.intel.io/resources/intel-oneapi-news-and-updates/[]
