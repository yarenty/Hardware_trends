Extract from website(or internet news) - latest product details, ie:

- hardware description,
- software capabilities,
- benchmarking - MLPerf output.

Mostly about latest development - latest chip, or latest version of software - at the end this is all about technology trends not full history of each company.

Third seciton is ... note from me ;-) - short investigation about what was going on lately in the company, ie: last year activity /development / are they growing or stagnating.
