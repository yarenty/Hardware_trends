[NOTE]
====
Yosys is a framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. It currently has extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms for various application domains.

====

Selected features and typical applications:

- Process almost any synthesizable Verilog-2005 design
- Converting Verilog to BLIF / EDIF/ BTOR / SMT-LIB / simple RTL Verilog / etc.
- Built-in formal methods for checking properties and equivalence
- Mapping to ASIC standard cell libraries (in Liberty File Format)
- Mapping to Xilinx 7-Series and Lattice iCE40 FPGAs
- Foundation and/or front-end for custom flows


Yosys can be adapted to perform any synthesis job by combining the existing passes (algorithms) using synthesis scripts and adding additional passes as needed by extending the Yosys C++ code base.


Yosys is free software licensed under the ISC license (a GPL compatible license that is similar in terms to the MIT license or the 2-clause BSD license).
