*Synplify Pro*

* Logic Synthesis for FPGA Design

Synplify Pro® FPGA synthesis software is the industry standard for producing high-performance and cost-effective FPGA designs. Synplify software supports the latest VHDL and Verilog language constructs including SystemVerilog and VHDL-2008. The software also supports FPGA architectures from a variety of FPGA vendors, including Altera, Achronix, Lattice, Microsemi and Xilinx, all from a single RTL and constraint source. Synplify Pro software uses a single, easy-to-use interface and has the ability to perform incremental synthesis and intuitive HDL code analysis.

For designers of large designs that need the fastest possible synthesis runtimes and the highest quality timing, area and power results. Synplify® Premier software provides all of the features of Synplify Pro as well as a comprehensive suite of tools for advanced FPGA design, see the Synplify Feature Comparison Chart.

*RTL Architect*


The Synopsys RTL Architect™ product represents the industry’s first physically-aware RTL analysis, exploration, and optimization system with signoff technology integration.

RTL Architect uses a fast, multi-dimensional implementation prediction engine that enables RTL designers to predict the power, performance, area, and congestion impact of their RTL changes. Built on a unified data model, RTL Architect directly leverages Synopsys’ world-class implementation and golden signoff solutions, including PrimePower RTL, to deliver results that are accurate early in the design cycle. RTL Architect enables designers to significantly reduce RTL development time and to achieve “Simply Better RTL."
