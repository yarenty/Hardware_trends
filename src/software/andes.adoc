*Coder Perspective*

A fully functional Andes Assembly, C and C++ integrated development environment with various perspective views help users on multiple project management. The coder perspective houses Project Explorer View, Code Editor, Target Manager and Console View. Users can create, delete, and change project configurations and manage build system in Project Explorer View. On the Project Properties window, any project build related options, including toolchain selections, assembler, compiler, linker and debugger options and environment settings can be done through self-explanatory graphical user interfaces. The source code editor comes with syntax highlighting, code folding and auto-complete features which can help users edit the imported or newly created source code.

*Configuration Setting*

More options are added in Project Configuration to provide fine-grained control on the executable image generation, such as start-up code tailor, program loading address, and customized linker script file. In addition to compiler, assembler and linker, user can also configure a few useful utility programs from Configuration Settings, such as objdump, readelf, nm objcopy and size.

*Debug Perspective*

The Debug Perspective consists of the Code Editor, Target Manager and Debug Views that aid users in diagnosing each step in the program execution. The rich diagnosis features help users monitor system information during debugging process, such as execution stack outlining and active threads for each target on Debug Views and source-level debugging status in Code Editor. The Memory View provides users memory content display and modification functions with user specified addresses. On the Disassembly View, users can see both high-level source code and its associated assembler code and identify issues in instruction level during debugging process even the program is written in high level programming language.
