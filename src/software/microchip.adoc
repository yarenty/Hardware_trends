Starting with Libero SoC Design Suite v12.0, we are supporting PolarFire SoC(Starting from  Libero v12.5),PolarFire, RTG4, SmartFusion2 and IGLOO2 FPGA families. Libero SoC Design Suite supports Enhanced Constraints Flow only and it does not support Classic Constraints flow. If the users developed their designs using these FPGA families in Libero SoC v11.9 SP2 or earlier releases and would like to migrate your designs to Libero SoC Design Suite v12.0, please read the instructions given in the "Migrating Designs to Libero SoC v12.0" section in the Libero SoC Design Suite v12.0 release notes.

Libero SoC v11.9 and earlier (including its service packs) will continue to support IGLOO2, SmartFusion2, RTG4, SmartFusion, IGLOO, ProASIC3 and Fusion families, as well as IGLOO2, SmartFusion2, and RTG4 (both Classic and Enhanced Constraint Flows). However, the Libero SoC v11.9 software branch is in maintenance mode, and only critical bug fixes will be made going forward.

Microchip gets the same approach as Archonix - uses / extends existing tools for it's own product.
