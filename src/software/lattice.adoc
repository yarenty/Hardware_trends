Lattice software packs are quite big, however looking for licensing types, there is conclusion that different applications are designed to different chip architectures. This could means that software could be small and _"properly cut"_ however trend is to avoid confusion - and build one SDK pack - like Xilinx.

* Lattice Propel Design Environment

image:../img/lattice_Propel_Logo.png[]

Lattice Propel is a complete set of graphical and command-line tools to create, analyze, compile, and debug both FPGA-based processor system hardware and software design.


Our new Lattice Propel design environment is optimized for the use of low-power, small form-factor FPGAs by easily assembling components from a robust IP library including a RISC-V processor core and numerous peripherals.

A general problem for software developers, until now, they have been intimidated by the thought of using traditional FPGA design tools and hardware description languages (HDLs). As a result, they have been at the mercy of hardware design engineers to configure and implement the RISC-V processor on the FPGA.

The solution is Lattice Propel™, which is a state-of-the-art standalone graphical user interface (GUI)-based design environment that allows any user (with or without FPGA expertise) to employ a drag-and-drop methodology to capture and configure a RISC-V processor-based design in minutes.

Propel allows software developers to achieve success in minutes, from simple “Hello World” type applications to complex embedded control and data processing systems.
Figure 2. Propel allows software developers to achieve success in minutes, from simple “Hello World” type applications to complex embedded control and data processing systems.

In addition to drag-and-drop instantiation, the Propel Builder features automated pin-to-pin connections, wizard-guided configuration and parameterization, and correct-by-construction IP integration.

Propel also boasts a seamless software development environment in the form of a software development kit (SDK) that features an industry-standard integrated development environment (IDE) and toolchain. The SDK features software/hardware debugging capabilities along with software libraries and board support packages (BSPs) for Propel-defined systems.

The output from Propel is an RTL file in Verilog HDL that can be passed to the synthesis engine, which generates the configuration file to be loaded into the FPGA. This configuration file can be targeted at the Lattice MachXO3D™, Mach™-NX, CrossLink™-NX, and Certus™-NX FPGA families.

Now, software developers no longer need to wait for their hardware counterparts. Once they’ve configured the FPGA with their RISC-V design, they can run their RISC-V executable files on this FPGA-based RISC-V implementation as they would with any other RISC-V processor. The availability of Lattice Propel opens a world of possibilities for software developers.

Design Environment for Lattice FPGA-based Processor System Design - Lattice Propel is a complete set of graphical and command-line tools to create, analyze, compile, and debug both the hardware design of an FPGA-based processor system, and the software design for that processor system.

Lattice Propel Builder - An easy to use system IP integration environment, Propel Builder provides tools to integrate processors and peripheral IP. The graphical integration environment features an easy-to-use, drag and drop correct-by-construction methodology. All commands are Tcl scriptable.

Lattice Propel SDK - A seamless software development environment, Propel SDK is a software development kit (SDK) with an integrated industry standard IDE and toolchain. The SDK features SW/HW debugging capabilities along with software libraries and board support packages (BSP) for Propel Builder defined systems.

Features

- Drag and drop IP instantiation
- Correct by construction design methodology
- High productivity HW/SW debugging
- Software libraries and BSP support
- Tcl scripting commands

Whn looking on license page there could be made conclusion that different software pack is designed for different architecture of chips.
