*Intel® DPC++ Compatibility Tool*


* Efficient Code Migration

The Intel® DPC++ Compatibility Tool assists in migrating your existing CUDA code to Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) code
DPC++ is based on ISO C++ and incorporates standard SYCL* and community extensions to simplify data parallel programming

* How It Works

The tool ports both CUDA language kernels and library API calls
Typically, 80%-90% of CUDA code automatically migrates to DPC++ code
Inline comments help you finish writing and tuning your DPC++ code


* What You Need

The Intel DPC++ Compatibility Tool is included in the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit
It integrates into familiar IDEs, including Eclipse* and Microsoft Visual Studio*

.Note from Jaro
====
oneAPI focuses currently on GPUs. There is specific compatibility tool which automatically migrates CUDA to DPC (Data Parallel C++)

Feb9, 2021 - oneAPI Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) features are included in the SYCL 2020 final specification, released today by The Khronos Group, an open consortium of industry-leading companies creating advanced interoperability standards.
