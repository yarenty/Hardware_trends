AI reasoning
Baidu: Kunlun considers multiple loads + multiple scenarios (from DC to Edge), and the design is more flexible and programmable
Alibaba: Hanguang mainly considers CNN calculations in DC scenarios, and can extend workload mapping
Lightmatter: Mars Photonics Compute Core + Electronic I/O, Buffer, solve dark silicon, general AI
