ETH: Manticore Quad-Chiplet, 22nm, fp32 calculation comparable to v100 (12nm), fp64 surpasses v100



link:https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06502.pdf[]


● Small core, large FPU
● SSR/FREP combats von Neumann
bottleneck
● Extreme efficiency on fp64
● Competitive on fp32

Next steps:
● “Quad-chiplet” prototype board
● Larger prototype silicon (FinFET)
● Looking for industrial partners for  D2D/HBM/DDR PHY integration
