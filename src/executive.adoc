Presented report shows 2021 trends in area of: 

- *CPU* - including server, mobile, and edge, where currently one can see big change starting from moving from Intel processors /  architectures to "self-made" ARMs and RISC-V. Starting with: Apple and its new M1 chip - specialized SoC with CPU, GPU and NPU on-board; nVidia acquiring ARM; Amazon, Microsoft, Google - designing their own chip. Not to mention existing chips producers or academic initiatives like part of H2020 - Manticore, a general-purpose, ultra-efficient, RISC-V, chiplet-based architecture for data-parallel floating-point workloads. Intel new line of CPUs could be "politically corectly" called "not impressive".

- *GPU* - GPUs arena is dominated by nVidia, however there are quite few interesting solutions especially in GPUs designed specially for ML purposes - like Intel "Ponte Vecchio" high-performance, highly flexible discrete general-purpose GPU architected for HPC modeling and simulation workloads and AI training; or extreme one - like cerberas wafer =  -56x the size of the largest GPU. The Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine is 46,225 mm2 with 1.2 Trillion transistors and 400,000 AI-optimized cores.

- *NPU / TPU / DPU / IPU / xPU* - all ASIC specialized hardware, starting with: Google TPU (benchmarks for currently unknown TPU .v4 was just released); Intels Gaudi - training, Goya - inference processors; through very specialized Marvell, Fungible DPU solutions. Competition here is hard, and quite selective - at the end those are still ASICs - you cannot use them for other tasks than their definition.

- *FPGA* - re-programmable hardware. This space generally is occupied by Xilinx and Intel (80%) with Lattice on third place. However this area (together with SoC - which sometimes is hard to distinguish) is definitely booming, and this is not only looking for technical trends and advantages that FPGA is giving but also growing development software, interfaces with high-level languages, or looking at the big business movements like acquisition of Xilinx by AMD.   

- *SoC* - CPUs, that contains not only GPUs, but also parts of FPGAs/xPUs - not focusing again on Apple M1 chips, or big ARM ecosystem, there is expotentialy growing of specialized RISC-V solution: Celerity, Manticore, SiFive, including so specialized solutions like Seagate or Wester Digital (storage solution providers)  used for real time processing.

- *Quantum* - this is quite futuristic as of today - but it grows, and have some hype, so worth to have some initial insight, and could be something to follow up.

On top of that there is software part - just keep in mind that FPGAs or advanced SoCs - are "double-deal" - they could not exists without specialized software allowing developers to properly utilize all of the possibilities that hardware has to offer. And while there are still lots of solutions tailored to fit particular chips, but real trend is about open IDEs with support of high level languages that could be used on multivendor chipsets. Personnaly I'm in big favour of that trend as example of Xilinx Vitis shows how unified programming model for accelerating Edge, Cloud, and Hybrid computing applications, accelerates not only solutions but also extremely squeezes development time.



Building custom chips is becoming practical due to the evolution of the electronic design tools and the semiconductor manufacturing industry, which has lowered market entry.

Custom chips can complement existing designs or processors while adding product differentiation. Extract from Gartner recommendations:

• Assess the priority of adopting custom ICs by conducting a cost analysis on your current product vis-à-vis future products and the impacts of technology migration.
• Develop a flexible strategy about sourcing custom ICs by carefully navigating through the semiconductor design and manufacturing market, your in-house skills and R&D expertise.
• Develop product strategies to be competitive by identifying specific technical requirements that can be addressed with custom ICs not covered by existing suppliers.

Recent success of Apple M1 just proved that investing in own designs/solutions you can get best possible performance, power, cost ... Generally - this is *rennesaince of semiconductors*, and everyone currently is trying to get some piece of that cake.
