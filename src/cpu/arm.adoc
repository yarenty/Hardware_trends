Design requirements:
New IoT devices (such as smart speakers) require signal processing and AI calculations

ARM solution:
Regardless of multi-core (complex software, high power consumption), increase the computing power on the basis of the existing NPU, while satisfying DSP and AI, and try to localize the calculations
Improve Cortex-M performance without too much power consumption





Edge:
ARM: Cortex M55 + Ethos-U55 (CNN, RNN acceleration) signal processing/AI calculation acceleration
Harvard: PGMA probability calculation acceleration (Bayesian/MRF/HMM) + algorithm/architecture joint design
