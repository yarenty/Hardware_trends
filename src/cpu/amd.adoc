AMD: Energy efficiency improvement dominates micro-architecture + processor architecture innovation to promote the overall performance of Renior


- 2014: In- crease the energy efficiency of mobile processors by 25 in 2020
- 2020: "Renior" completes 31x energy efficiency improvement, the processor is mainly used for ultra-thin notebooks; 5x performance improvement, 84% lower energy consumption


Zen2 CPU micro-architecture optimization:

- 15% IPC improvement compared to Zen; hierarchical cache optimization for Renior; each Renior Die has two Zen2 cores
- VEGA GPU maximizes the efficiency of each processing unit
- 25% increase in peak graphics clock + 77% increase in peak memory bandwidth; 2x data interface
- Two memory controllers
- Infinity fabric
- 75% better energy efficiency; 77% higher memory bandwidth



Intelligent low-power state selection

- Increase in power consumption status exposed to ACPI: 1 -> 3
- Optimize the duration and depth of each state

Optimize battery life

- SoC power consumption reduced by 20%
- Low power state management and efficiency improvement

Closed loop "thermal" management system

- Hot spot temperature sensing
- The temperature information is transmitted to the infinity fabric through the embedded controller
- The system dynamically adjusts the power consumption limit according to the external temperature information of the machine

====
AMD proposition is actually something that you should see from Intel. On top of they own technologies CDNA/Zen/EPYC/RoC lastly they acquired Xilinx - so AMD will have "full ecosystem: CPUs,GPUs,FPGAs,SoCs". From competitiveness and business perspectives AMD moves makes a lot of sense.
