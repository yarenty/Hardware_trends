# Hardware_trends


Currently there are 6 main areas:

1. *CPU* - advances in CPUs (including server, mobile, and edge).
2. *GPU* - standard GPUs and specialized one - like cerberas wafer.
3. *NPU / TPU / DPU / IPU / xPU* - all ASIC type solutions - specialized hardware.
4. *FPGA* - re-programmable hardware.
5. *SoC* - advanced CPUs, that contains not only GPUs, but also parts of FPGAs/xPUs - ie: Apple M1 chip.
6. *Quantum* - this is quite futuristic as of today - but it grows, and have some hype, so worth to have some initial insight, and be something to follow up.

There are companies that has products in more than one area (IBM,Intel,AMD,nVidia ..) so you could see it's name/products distributed among those areas.

There are products that could be categorized in more than one area since there is thin line between ie: CPU or SoC - so there could be some confusions - I tried to put them into the category where I feel it belongs (at least at current stage).

In future, I may reorganize report to be on company-by-company basis.

NOTE: CPUs is here to have general/complete view, at the end they are not accelerators.

*Structure*


```asciidoc

Each chapter contains 3 sections:

1.
Introduction to company/products in form of NOTE. 

Example:
[NOTE]
====
Short summary about company and latest product/development - few bullet points.

Website to follow up, ie:  link:http://yarenty.com
====

2. 
Extract from website / news - latest product details, ie: 

- hardware description, 
- software capabilities, 
- benchmarking - MLPerf output.

Content presented is mostly about latest development - latest chip, or latest version of software - at the end this is all about technology trends not full history of each company.


3.
Third seciton is ... note from reporter ;-) - short investigation about what was going on lately in the company, ie: last year activity / development / rumours / are they growing or stagnating. 

Example:
[IMPORTANT].Note from Jaro
====
Hardware Acceleration is Booming ;-)
